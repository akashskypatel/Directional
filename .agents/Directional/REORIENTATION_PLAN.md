## 1. Purpose and authority

This plan owns migration order, dependencies, stop conditions, and acceptance gates. It does not redefine the architecture.

| Concern | Authority |
|---|---|
| Product, stages, domains, invariants, disposition | DESIGN.md |
| Historical redesign and initial R-A findings | Architecture_Redesign_and_M1_RA_Independent_Review_Report.md |
| Current implementation plan | Architecture_M1_Single_Authority_Cutover_Code_Build_Plan.md |
| Dormant immutable validation plan | Architecture_M1_Single_Authority_Cutover_Artifact_Only_Test_Benchmark_Plan.md |
| Normative testing | tests/TESTING_STRATEGY.md |
| Current action/status | TODO.md and Future_Chat_Session_Handoff.md |
| Stable defect patterns and blockers | Regression_Root_Cause_Tracker.md |
| Completed history | CHANGELOG.md and retained historical reports |

If this roadmap conflicts with DESIGN.md, DESIGN.md wins and this roadmap must be corrected before implementation.

## 2. Pipeline decision

### Pipeline B — normative default

Pipeline B contains no global coordinate integration or numeric factorization:

1. A0 SourceAuthoritySnapshot;
2. A1 FieldTransportAtlas, including field quadrangulability;
3. A2a FieldAlignedCurveNetwork;
4. A2b GlobalTopologyPlan;
5. A3 GlobalConformityPlan through deterministic polynomial graph/flow work and strictly positive rail lengths;
6. A4 direct per-region surface-cell construction;
7. A5 occurrence publication;
8. A6 quotient/materialization;
9. A7 geometry embedding;
10. A8 independent verification and disposition;
11. A9 diagnostics/export.

### Pipeline A — optional future

Pipeline A may later replace A2a with one integer-free continuous global solve, isoline/motorcycle extraction, and per-region embedding. It is not implemented, not tested, not scheduled, and not an acceptance requirement. It becomes eligible only after Pipeline B is Certified on the complete representative matrix with stable calibrated quality gates and evidence that integration would materially improve output quality.

## 3. Product disposition

The verifier assigns:

- D0 Certified: complete pure quad, all structural and calibrated quality gates;
- D1 QualityRelaxed: complete pure quad, structural gates pass, named calibrated quality gate misses;
- D2 LocallyDegraded: complete pure quad, named regions produced by the declared degraded producer;
- D3 Partial: pure-quad subset, explicitly omitted regions;
- D4 DiagnosticOnly: no mesh and typed failure/certificate evidence.

Only the closed catastrophic set in DESIGN.md may produce D4. Degradation may occur only at A3/A4/A8 as designed, is bounded and non-recursive, never changes upstream authority, and never closes a strict gate.

## 4. Revised migration sequence

The 2026-08-11 redesign retains prior M0-M2, maps prior M3 to M4, prior M4 to M5, prior M5 to M6, and prior M6 to M8, and introduces M3 and M7.

| Milestone | Contract | State |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | preserve immutable evidence | complete |
| M1 | single-authority cutover | active; R-A closure gate rejected, R-A-REV-11 through R-A-REV-13 open |
| M2 | closed stage products and single writers | pending |
| M3 | field-aligned curve network | pending |
| M4 | global conformity plan | pending |
| M5 | certificate-carrying chart and quotient relations | pending |
| M6 | occurrence, embedding, independent verification | pending |
| M7 | disposition and graded degradation | pending |
| M8 | module boundaries and operational hardening | pending |

Later milestones are complete vertical contracts driven by the active Pipeline B product need. They are not permission for representation-only letter slices or compatibility bridges.

## 5. Current M1 checkpoint

### Immutable entering authority

M1a-M1l and T1 were accepted under their retained immutable evidence. M1l source bd140cff4572412e6f4ecd70a6ce0fe85310932c remains the latest runtime-accepted authority.

Rejected and partial package identities remain historical evidence in `CHANGELOG.md`; none is an M1 acceptance candidate.

### R-A closure review

The working branch through `1c4f631...` was reviewed against the complete R-A gate. Implementation/test source ends at exact compiled source `d8d648a...`; later commits contain documentation and temporary workflow/payload cleanup only. No generated runtime or discovery executed in the compile run or this Review.

Established:

- row-independent face topology plus typed sheet membership;
- private checked SurfaceTopologyRegion and SourceTopologyRegions factories;
- exact row/member coverage and typed component/sheet agreement;
- builder-only raw classifier ingress;
- SourceEntityId removal;
- owning source-authority consumer APIs;
- materializer API without parallel raw component/sheet arrays;
- the earlier materializer, fallback-encoding, exact-only-publication, and strict optimizer/verifier corrections remain;
- the latest checkpoint authentically compiles Release/static/Ninja/PRE_TEST **118/118** from exact source, with clean source provenance and a self-excluding manifest **20/20**.

Not closed:

- R-A-REV-11: an existing exact stitch key merges on matching position without validating incoming typed-authority compatibility;
- R-A-REV-12: multi-component remap can publish incomplete typed chart/support lineage, and its current contract is a helper-only proxy rather than an end-to-end production merge;
- R-A-REV-13: the claimed complete audit samples selected paths and substrings and does not detect REV-11 or REV-12.

R-A is not an accepted migration and no partial artifact is eligible for artifact-only acceptance. Exact checkpoint identities remain in `CHANGELOG.md` rather than this live roadmap.

## 6. M1 completion sequence

The next Code + Build turn must:

1. close R-A-REV-11 with per-collision typed-authority compatibility validation and positive/negative exact-key contracts;
2. close R-A-REV-12 with checked fail-closed component remap, post-remap lineage validation, and end-to-end multi-component contracts;
3. close R-A-REV-13 with a complete failing affected-path/symbol/read audit that detects REV-11 and REV-12;
4. rerun and pass the full R-A closure inventory;
5. complete R-B through R-G under the active Code + Build plan;
6. produce a fresh self-verifying full package using the verified packaging rules, without generated runtime.

The resulting package is independently validated under the retained artifact-only plan. M1 closes only when static authority, focused contracts, entering semantic gates, direct product oracles, known-red classification, characterization, and immutable postflight all close.

M1 must not implement M3 curve-network topology, M4 conformity flow, M7 degradation, or Pipeline A.

## 7. M2-M8 acceptance orientation

### M2 — closed products

Every applicable producer publishes one immutable exhaustive outcome. Rejected is terminal for that producer. Aggregators validate/remap representation only and never reconstruct semantics.

### M3 — field-aligned curve network

Prove singularity-port ownership, branch-consistent non-crossing tracing, typed termination, complete mandatory topology, disc-region proofs, and permutation invariance. The adapted tracing plus motorcycle decomposition requires its own proof and corpus evidence. A1 quadrangulability needs a constructible certificate and tamper oracle.

### M4 — global conformity

Publish one positive shared schedule before regional production. Use a deterministic polynomial graph/flow algorithm with explicit tie-breaking and work bounds. Infeasible rail subsets become typed subset-scoped D3 inputs. Resolve G4-B002 without post-hoc pairing.

### M5 — relations

Publish explicit relation owners and selected path certificates. Verify them independently. Resolve nonzero periodic Z4 and multi-isolation evidence without relation-vector position or verifier reconstruction.

### M6 — occurrence, embedding, verification

Separate occurrences, quotient construction, materialization, geometry embedding, and elementary independent verification. Establish injective region interiors and calibrated geometry/field/quality evidence.

### M7 — disposition

Introduce OutputDisposition, DegradationCertificate, omitted-region bookkeeping, verifier tier recomputation, and exactly one declared degraded producer as one vertical contract. Prove every tier, both directions of certificate matching, non-interference, determinism, and D0-only strict gates.

### M8 — hardening

Enforce module dependency boundaries, diagnostic non-authority, resource/work accounting, packaging, CI, and removal of remaining tracked architecture debt.

## 8. Testing interlock

Every migration preserves T1 and adds evidence at the correct layer:

- L0 schemas and invalid construction;
- L1 positive/tamper stage contracts;
- L2 metamorphic and generated properties;
- L3 independent semantic oracle;
- L4 full direct representative matrix;
- L5 fuzz/sanitizer replay;
- L6 calibrated quality/resource gates.

Pipeline B strict representative gates require D0. D1-D3 are separately tested truthful outputs, never green substitutes. Pipeline A cannot borrow Pipeline B acceptance if it is later adopted.

## 9. Design clarification gates

Before the owning milestone closes:

1. correct the DESIGN.md section 6.7 D1/degradation-record wording inconsistency;
2. prove the M3 combined tracing/decomposition algorithm;
3. define and verify A1 quadrangulability certificates;
4. specify and prove the M7 degraded region producer;
5. calibrate the D0/D1 quality boundary.

The supplied DESIGN.md remains byte-for-byte normative until a separately reviewed correction is authorized.

## 10. Stop conditions

Stop and revise the owning plan if a change:

- creates a second semantic owner or raw mirror;
- reads a diagnostic/export encoding as authority;
- uses a face row, vector position, hash, or execution order as semantic identity;
- restores an adapter, alias, compatibility numbering, fallback, or reconstruction bridge;
- allows a producer/verifier/aggregator to rewrite upstream meaning;
- introduces a global solve into Pipeline B;
- degrades outside A3/A4/A8, without a substantiated certificate, recursively, or to pass a strict gate;
- schedules Pipeline A before its eligibility gates;
- weakens a fixture, oracle, validator, lineage, failure, or no-substitution contract;
- uses compile success as runtime or semantic acceptance.

## 11. Resume rule

Current exact action is the amended M1 Code + Build plan. The artifact-only plan remains dormant until a fresh full R-A-through-R-G package exists. After M1 acceptance, choose the smallest revised M2-M8 contract that owns the highest-prerequisite active Pipeline B product blocker.
