# Directional Surface-Cell TODO

Last updated: 2026-09-05 UTC

## Purpose

This is the single durable **task index** — open and blocked work only. It is deliberately forward-looking.

Closed milestone/checkpoint history lives in `M1_Closure_Record.md`, `M2_Closure_Record.md`, `M3_CP2_Closure_Record.md`, `M3_CP2b_Closure_Record.md`, `M3_CP3_Closure_Record.md`, and `M3_CP4ab_Closure_Record.md`. Exact runtime evidence lives in `CHANGELOG.md`, the current retained turn report, and `Regression_Root_Cause_Tracker.md`. Normative architecture lives in `DESIGN.md`; the checkpoint map to production-ready lives in `ROADMAP.md`; migration ordering lives in `REORIENTATION_PLAN.md`.

**Do not re-accumulate per-checkpoint, per-retry, or per-partial narrative here.** A closed checkpoint gets one line in `ROADMAP.md` §1 and a closure record; it does not stay in this file.

## Turn workflow — changed 2026-08-25

```
CB  →  TB  →  green?  →  checkpoint CLOSES
                ↓ red
        REVIEW + PLAN  →  CB  →  …
```

**Non-gating diagnostic identities** TB executes and reports them, the
gate count excludes them, each carries a written rationale and an owning corrective measure.

**`DEFN` absorbs `REVIEW + PLAN` — user-authorized 2026-08-30.** When `DEFN` is the next step in the chain it **is**
the review-and-plan turn: one turn freezes definitions, adjudicates inherited candidates, decides gate membership,
and issues the successor's measures. Only the `REVIEW+PLAN → DEFN` edge collapses; a red TB with no `DEFN` ahead of
it still gets its own review turn.

## Current focus — `M3-CP4c-3-TB28-INDEPENDENT-REVIEW` (mandatory review + correction freeze)

`M3-CP4c-3-TB28` is **COMPLETE / VALID ARTIFACT-ONLY RUNTIME / FULL SELECTOR407 GREEN / CHECKPOINT SEMANTICALLY UNACCEPTED PENDING REVIEW**. Authoritative R2 run `33990951740` consumed immutable CB32 artifact `9975737868` from source `098ac7d93ea203222dd0ac50cdb68667744f0fd4` with selector407 (407 identities, LF SHA-256 `9e5b7c62901b694399b215bc02a5ade09f3466795b20181c42a039a32f9718ae`). Result/log artifacts are `9976662518` (`970573beb31bc43bb2cbcd4dee957edfb2f23c0c543edfe9997c5dcfc487053d`) and `9976662690` (`4272bd5fc1750d19c9fceb94daf3be8367b05d6fa9e13828fc6a97c1c6fe44d`). All 407 selector rows passed; build/source/test/fixture/selector mutation remained false and package/binary/selector postflight was unchanged.

R1 run `33990315861` is orchestration-invalid/non-semantic only: it failed before runtime on an incorrect package-layout assumption and contributes no semantic evidence.

TB28 CL6/CL7 measurement keeps `ReliefTopologyBuildFailed`, failing plan component `1`, 27 candidate faces, `candidateFacesEqualCensusComponent=false`, `candidateFacesSubsetOfCensusComponent=true`, zero census failures, and 101/101 untruncated failing-plan interior-arc rows. The decisive published row is `arc=(0,2):sourceFace=0:certifierComponent=0:planComponent=1:notTraceCutReason=TerminalSlit`. This measures the partition mismatch; it does **not** itself choose the product correction. Stable regression accounting remains **44 events / 14 categories / 30 recurrences**, produced-witness debt **5**.

### Exact next turn

- [ ] Perform **`M3-CP4c-3-TB28-INDEPENDENT-REVIEW`** against the immutable TB28 R2 report/evidence.
- [ ] Freeze exactly one product correction under CL8 using the measured CL6/CL7 evidence; do not run a fourth standalone diagnostic turn.
- [ ] Reconcile `M3-CP4c3-TB27-REV-CAND-01`, `M3-CP4c3-TB27-REV-CAND-02`, and `M3-CP4c3-TB25-REV-CAND-02` with the TB28 crossed-face/component evidence.
- [ ] Update `ORIENTATION.md` during that REVIEW turn and perform the mandatory REVIEW document consolidation before closeout.

**CL8 — HARD STOP RULE.** No further source-face ownership diagnostic or product correction is authorized before this independent review. The review must freeze the correction from the now-complete TB28 evidence; it may not defer to another standalone diagnostic turn.

## Carried forward from M1

**Produced-witness debt — `G4-B002` → revised M4 (3).** A fourth reopens section 14 scheduling.
- [ ] Re-prove `CandidateExtractionBaselineForCanonicalSourceScopeIdentityIsNonVacuous` on a produced closed complex.
- [ ] Re-prove `PeriodicRelationOwnersSurviveContainerReorderingBeforeMaterialization` through the torus pipeline.
- [ ] Re-prove `MissingPeriodicRelationOwnerIsRejected` on produced periodic authority.

**Produced-witness debt — `G4-B003` → M5 (2).** A third reopens M5 scheduling.
- [ ] Re-prove `FullPeriodicRotationAndTranslationMaterialize` on produced nonzero-Z4 authority.
- [ ] Re-prove `TamperedFullPeriodicTransformIsRejected` on produced nonzero-Z4 authority.

**Criterion-5 disposition re-proof → M7.**
- [ ] Re-express M1 criterion 5 in disposition terms and re-run F1/F2/F3 under verifier-assigned `Certified`. M7 does not close until green.

## Deferred hygiene

- [ ] **Repair `.github/workflows/agent-turn-cleanup.yml` comment handling and trigger safety.** The workflow still deletes **all** PR conversation and inline review comments before its observer step, and creating `.agents/connector-triggers/turn-cleanup/manifest.txt` auto-triggers it. Run `32591251950 / 97075340976` demonstrated 27 conversation-comment deletions. User commit `c359ea925b04471500575a9dcc17bdc6e4bb52d1` explicitly superseded the old prohibition by requiring the manifest/workflow at every turn closeout. Until the workflow is repaired, preserve durable repository evidence before publishing the closeout manifest and treat PR comments as non-durable.

Inherited baseline-red / non-gating fixtures remain frozen in the M1 exclusion register. None may become required-green evidence before its precondition is independently established.

- [ ] `WU2A-TB-CAND-01`: successful-side-subdivision ownership-registry precondition.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-01`: hard-rail region-copy valid front-boundary-authority precondition.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-02`: side-repair rollback ownership-registry/domain-identity precondition.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-03`: authoritative-cell-scope subdivision source-scope reconciliation.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-04`: five simplification fixtures need independently proven removable/protected/healing preconditions.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-05`: FlowRep mandatory-cycle witness needs `selectionSucceeded=true` before later-cycle evidence is creditable.
- [ ] `RA-REV-23-F3`: dispatch stitch-kind audit through an explicit classifier field rather than probe-name text; add a negative self-test.
- [ ] `RA-REV-22-F6`: remove non-falsifiable validation-used assertions or set them where each gate actually executes.
- [ ] `RA-TB6-H1`: repair repeated `TriMesh::set_mesh` / `DCEL::init` stale halfedge-twin reinitialization outside the R-A fixture path.

## Milestone status

Checkpoint decomposition, per-milestone acceptance mapping, and the path to production-ready are in **`ROADMAP.md`**. Summary only:

- [x] **M0** preserve evidence  ·  [x] **M1** single-authority cutover  ·  [x] **M2** closed stage products
- [ ] **M3 — field-aligned curve network.** CP4ab, CP4c-0, CP4c-0b, CP4c-1 and **CP4c-2** are accepted.
  CP4c-3 remains open. **TB28-R2 is the latest valid semantic runtime**: selector407 is 407/407 GREEN on
  immutable CB32 package `9975737868` / source `098ac7d93ea203222dd0ac50cdb68667744f0fd4`, while CL6/CL7
  measures the source-face partition mismatch and leaves correction selection review-owned.
  Exact next: **`M3-CP4c-3-TB28-INDEPENDENT-REVIEW`** under CL8.

- [ ] **M4** global conformity plan — also discharges the 3 `G4-B002` produced-witness debts.
- [ ] **M5** certificate-carrying chart/quotient relations — also discharges the 2 `G4-B003` debts.
- [ ] **M6** occurrence, embedding, independent verification.
- [ ] **M7** disposition and graded degradation — D0–D4 plus the M1 criterion-5 forward re-proof.
- [ ] **M8** module boundaries and operational hardening — `M8-CP3` is the production-ready exit.
- [ ] **Pipeline A.** Unscheduled until Pipeline B is Certified and evidence shows integration would materially improve quality.

## Active product blockers

- [ ] **CP4c-3 source-face ownership derivation:** TB28-R2 now publishes complete failing-plan interior-arc rows and
  directly measures `arc=(0,2):sourceFace=0:certifierComponent=0:planComponent=1:notTraceCutReason=TerminalSlit`;
  candidate faces are a subset but not equal to the census component. This closes the missing CL6/CL7 measurement,
  not the product decision. Exact correction is owned by **`M3-CP4c-3-TB28-INDEPENDENT-REVIEW`** under CL8; no
  barrier/attribution/partition/terminal-slit semantic change is authorized before that review.
- [x] **CP4c-3 ordinals 371/372 test coupling:** TB21's atlas-scoped accessor makes both identities execute their unchanged assertions and **PASS**. `M3-CP4c3-TB10-REV-CAND-01` is CLOSED / runtime proved.
- [x] **CP4c-3 ordinal 391 diagnostic dependency:** TB22 ordinal 391 PASSes; sphere is explicitly skipped with `reason=ordinal368-open` while mechanical/torus evidence runs. `M3-CP4c3-TB21-CAND-02` is CLOSED / runtime proved / non-stable.

- [ ] **CP4c-3 ordinal 374 (deferred, different owner):** the folded-cone AY5 witness declares a flat-star field (`effort ≡ 0`, no singularities) on a star with `Θ = 3π/2`, so the atlas rejects it with `CycleTransportMismatch`. Corrective is test-only — derive matching/effort/singularities with `directional::fields::principal_matching`, keep the exact expected-owner derivation, certify against the whole admissibility chain. Selector 374 stays byte-frozen and is **not** withdrawn. TB8 repeated this pre-classified stop; it adds no new product evidence.
- [ ] **Prescribed sphere A2a′ upstream error:** ordinal 368 is now repeatedly measured report-only at `RotationSystemInconsistent → TraceEventPositionInvalid`, trace 2/event 30, `NoCarrierMatch / SourceEdgeUnavailable`. AL4 still forbids a sphere semantic fix until separately reviewed.
- [ ] `G4-B001 / PR8-R034 / G4-R007`: direct torus final `LocalSheetMismatch`; downstream of A2b and not a CP4c witness collision.
- [ ] `G4-B002`: exact torus `InvalidHardRailPairing`; revised M4.
- [ ] `G4-B003`: nonzero periodic Z4 production; M5.
- [ ] `G4-B004`: positive multi-isolation quotient witness; M5/M6.
- [ ] Bunny/Vase representative production and resource acceptance — later product gates.

## Design and calibration backlog

- [ ] Own the closed-rail cardinality contract once at the rail product boundary rather than re-guarding both closed representations at every consumer.
- [ ] Calibrate `T5` quality/resource thresholds from measured baselines before any milestone asserts a quality gate.
- [ ] Correct `DESIGN.md` section 6.7 invariant 2 so D1 `QualityRelaxed` consistently records missed quality gates.
- [ ] Define the M7 degraded producer algorithm and its fixed-boundary completion proof.
- [ ] **Audit every remaining `kBranchTopologyTolerance` comparison for dimensional coherence.**
  `direction_in_incident_vertex_sector` compares a Gram **determinant** — an area-squared quantity — to
  `1e-10`. After E2/E3 the surviving uses are admissibility guards only, but their scale is arbitrary and
  mesh-size dependent. Not a CP4c-0 measure; do not fold it into CB2.
- [ ] **Sweep for other tolerant-selector / exact-consumer seams.** CP4c-0 found the pattern three times
  in one subsystem (flow classification, vertex sector, cross-edge flow). The same audit is owed wherever
  an exact authority was introduced downstream of a `double` decision.
