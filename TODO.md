# Directional Surface-Cell TODO

Last updated: 2026-09-04 UTC

## Purpose

This is the single durable **task index** — open and blocked work only. It is deliberately forward-looking.

Closed milestone/checkpoint history lives in `M1_Closure_Record.md`, `M2_Closure_Record.md`, `M3_CP2_Closure_Record.md`, `M3_CP2b_Closure_Record.md`, `M3_CP3_Closure_Record.md`, and `M3_CP4ab_Closure_Record.md`. Exact runtime evidence lives in `CHANGELOG.md`, the current retained turn report, and `Regression_Root_Cause_Tracker.md`. Normative architecture lives in `DESIGN.md`; the checkpoint map to production-ready lives in `ROADMAP.md`; migration ordering lives in `REORIENTATION_PLAN.md`.

**Do not re-accumulate per-checkpoint, per-retry, or per-partial narrative here.** A closed checkpoint gets one line in `ROADMAP.md` §1 and a closure record; it does not stay in this file.

## Turn workflow — changed 2026-08-25

```
CB  →  TB  →  green?  →  checkpoint CLOSES
                ↓ red
        REVIEW + PLAN  →  CB  →  …
```

**Non-gating diagnostic identities** TB executes and reports them, the
gate count excludes them, each carries a written rationale and an owning corrective measure.

**`DEFN` absorbs `REVIEW + PLAN` — user-authorized 2026-08-30.** When `DEFN` is the next step in the chain it **is**
the review-and-plan turn: one turn freezes definitions, adjudicates inherited candidates, decides gate membership,
and issues the successor's measures. Only the `REVIEW+PLAN → DEFN` edge collapses; a red TB with no `DEFN` ahead of
it still gets its own review turn.

## Current focus — `M3-CP4c-3-TB23-R1` (Test + Benchmark, ARTIFACT-ONLY RE-EXECUTION)

`M3-CP4c-3-CB26` is **COMPLETE / ORCHESTRATION CORRECTION VALIDATED / RUNTIME-NOT-EXECUTED / NO REBUILD**.
Record: `Architecture_M3_CP4c3_CB26_Code_Build_Report.md`.

CB26 discharged the frozen orchestration correction without changing semantic/package bytes:

- [x] **CD0** — reused package `9921914679`, source `e12396d4`, selector 397; no rebuild/repackage/product/test/fixture/selector change.
- [x] **CD1** — staged six immutable executables under `<execution-view>/bin` and packaged-source fixtures under `<execution-view>/test-data/benchmarks/fixtures`.
- [x] **CD2** — verified the known fixture through `TestFixturePaths.h`'s own two-candidate rule; `resolved_rule=sibling`.
- [x] **CD3** — fail-closed guard is before `runtime_started=true`.
- [x] **CD4** — required layout and resolution order are binding in the frozen TB23-R1 plan and committed harness.
- [x] **CD5** — invalid TB23-EXEC 342/55 ledger remains provenance only; nothing promoted.
- [x] **CD6** — fail-open resolver left unchanged/out of scope.
- [x] **CD7** — package/source census authorities reproduced exactly; package/source/view pre/post equality PASS.
- [x] **CD8** — TB23-R1 discriminator obligations frozen.

CB26 GitHub preflight `33838073812 / 100914602406` succeeded with result/log artifacts
`9923955664 / 9923956087`; `runtime_started=false`, no ledger produced, and no compile/relink/package repair or
source/test/fixture/selector mutation occurred.

### Exact next turn

Run **`M3-CP4c-3-TB23-R1`** against immutable package `9921914679` using
`.agents/Directional/tools/m3_cp4c3_tb23_r1_harness.sh --execute` and the frozen artifact-only plan.

- [ ] Execute all **397** identities in ordinal order, one exact identity per fresh process.
- [ ] Require accepted **1–365 = 365/365**.
- [ ] Require ordinal 366's carried locus: component 0 / `Multiple` / `[0,1,3]` / 191 faces.
- [ ] Publish CA3 examined/differing counts with examined non-zero.
- [ ] Publish independently measured component/labeled certified faces beside the seed for minority rows.
- [ ] Publish the failing-component certified-face multiset; one versus several names the live branch.
- [ ] Record 394–397 results; keep 367/368/369/370/374 carried and 371/372/391/392/393 PASS.
- [ ] Preserve package/source/execution-view byte+mode censuses and all no-mutation flags.
- [ ] Route the complete immutable result to **`M3-CP4c-3-TB23-R1-REV`**; do not diagnose/repair in TB.

Authoritative semantic runtime remains **TB22: 387 PASS / 6 RED, accepted 365/365** until TB23-R1 produces a valid
immutable ledger. CP4c-3 remains **OPEN**. Stable accounting remains **44 events / 14 categories / 30 recurrences**;
produced-witness debt **5**; authoritative semantic M3 package count **88**.

## Carried forward from M1

**Produced-witness debt — `G4-B002` → revised M4 (3).** A fourth reopens section 14 scheduling.
- [ ] Re-prove `CandidateExtractionBaselineForCanonicalSourceScopeIdentityIsNonVacuous` on a produced closed complex.
- [ ] Re-prove `PeriodicRelationOwnersSurviveContainerReorderingBeforeMaterialization` through the torus pipeline.
- [ ] Re-prove `MissingPeriodicRelationOwnerIsRejected` on produced periodic authority.

**Produced-witness debt — `G4-B003` → M5 (2).** A third reopens M5 scheduling.
- [ ] Re-prove `FullPeriodicRotationAndTranslationMaterialize` on produced nonzero-Z4 authority.
- [ ] Re-prove `TamperedFullPeriodicTransformIsRejected` on produced nonzero-Z4 authority.

**Criterion-5 disposition re-proof → M7.**
- [ ] Re-express M1 criterion 5 in disposition terms and re-run F1/F2/F3 under verifier-assigned `Certified`. M7 does not close until green.

## Deferred hygiene

- [ ] **Repair `.github/workflows/agent-turn-cleanup.yml` comment handling and trigger safety.** The workflow still deletes **all** PR conversation and inline review comments before its observer step, and creating `.agents/connector-triggers/turn-cleanup/manifest.txt` auto-triggers it. Run `32591251950 / 97075340976` demonstrated 27 conversation-comment deletions. User commit `c359ea925b04471500575a9dcc17bdc6e4bb52d1` explicitly superseded the old prohibition by requiring the manifest/workflow at every turn closeout. Until the workflow is repaired, preserve durable repository evidence before publishing the closeout manifest and treat PR comments as non-durable.

Inherited baseline-red / non-gating fixtures remain frozen in the M1 exclusion register. None may become required-green evidence before its precondition is independently established.

- [ ] `WU2A-TB-CAND-01`: successful-side-subdivision ownership-registry precondition.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-01`: hard-rail region-copy valid front-boundary-authority precondition.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-02`: side-repair rollback ownership-registry/domain-identity precondition.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-03`: authoritative-cell-scope subdivision source-scope reconciliation.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-04`: five simplification fixtures need independently proven removable/protected/healing preconditions.
- [ ] `WU2B-TB-CAND-05`: FlowRep mandatory-cycle witness needs `selectionSucceeded=true` before later-cycle evidence is creditable.
- [ ] `RA-REV-23-F3`: dispatch stitch-kind audit through an explicit classifier field rather than probe-name text; add a negative self-test.
- [ ] `RA-REV-22-F6`: remove non-falsifiable validation-used assertions or set them where each gate actually executes.
- [ ] `RA-TB6-H1`: repair repeated `TriMesh::set_mesh` / `DCEL::init` stale halfedge-twin reinitialization outside the R-A fixture path.

## Milestone status

Checkpoint decomposition, per-milestone acceptance mapping, and the path to production-ready are in **`ROADMAP.md`**. Summary only:

- [x] **M0** preserve evidence  ·  [x] **M1** single-authority cutover  ·  [x] **M2** closed stage products
- [ ] **M3 — field-aligned curve network.** CP4ab, CP4c-0, CP4c-0b, CP4c-1 and **CP4c-2** are accepted. CP4c-3 remains open; **CB25 is compile-green** at semantic source `e12396d...`, selector397/package88. Exact next: immutable **`M3-CP4c-3-TB23-R1`**.

- [ ] **M4** global conformity plan — also discharges the 3 `G4-B002` produced-witness debts.
- [ ] **M5** certificate-carrying chart/quotient relations — also discharges the 2 `G4-B003` debts.
- [ ] **M6** occurrence, embedding, independent verification.
- [ ] **M7** disposition and graded degradation — D0–D4 plus the M1 criterion-5 forward re-proof.
- [ ] **M8** module boundaries and operational hardening — `M8-CP3` is the production-ready exit.
- [ ] **Pipeline A.** Unscheduled until Pipeline B is Certified and evidence shows integration would materially improve quality.

## Active product blockers

- [ ] **CP4c-3 source-face seed/ownership projection:** CB25 replaced the vacuous/circular diagnostics with certificate-derived, independently sided, falsifiable measurements without changing product semantics. Both branches of `M3-CP4c3-TB21-CAND-01` remain live until valid TB23-R1 evidence is reviewed. Exact owner: `M3-CP4c-3-TB23-R1-REV`.
- [x] **CP4c-3 ordinals 371/372 test coupling:** TB21's atlas-scoped accessor makes both identities execute their unchanged assertions and **PASS**. `M3-CP4c3-TB10-REV-CAND-01` is CLOSED / runtime proved.
- [x] **CP4c-3 ordinal 391 diagnostic dependency:** TB22 ordinal 391 PASSes; sphere is explicitly skipped with `reason=ordinal368-open` while mechanical/torus evidence runs. `M3-CP4c3-TB21-CAND-02` is CLOSED / runtime proved / non-stable.

- [ ] **CP4c-3 ordinal 374 (deferred, different owner):** the folded-cone AY5 witness declares a flat-star field (`effort ≡ 0`, no singularities) on a star with `Θ = 3π/2`, so the atlas rejects it with `CycleTransportMismatch`. Corrective is test-only — derive matching/effort/singularities with `directional::fields::principal_matching`, keep the exact expected-owner derivation, certify against the whole admissibility chain. Selector 374 stays byte-frozen and is **not** withdrawn. TB8 repeated this pre-classified stop; it adds no new product evidence.
- [ ] **Prescribed sphere A2a′ upstream error:** ordinal 368 is now repeatedly measured report-only at `RotationSystemInconsistent → TraceEventPositionInvalid`, trace 2/event 30, `NoCarrierMatch / SourceEdgeUnavailable`. AL4 still forbids a sphere semantic fix until separately reviewed.
- [ ] `G4-B001 / PR8-R034 / G4-R007`: direct torus final `LocalSheetMismatch`; downstream of A2b and not a CP4c witness collision.
- [ ] `G4-B002`: exact torus `InvalidHardRailPairing`; revised M4.
- [ ] `G4-B003`: nonzero periodic Z4 production; M5.
- [ ] `G4-B004`: positive multi-isolation quotient witness; M5/M6.
- [ ] Bunny/Vase representative production and resource acceptance — later product gates.

## Design and calibration backlog

- [ ] Own the closed-rail cardinality contract once at the rail product boundary rather than re-guarding both closed representations at every consumer.
- [ ] Calibrate `T5` quality/resource thresholds from measured baselines before any milestone asserts a quality gate.
- [ ] Correct `DESIGN.md` section 6.7 invariant 2 so D1 `QualityRelaxed` consistently records missed quality gates.
- [ ] Define the M7 degraded producer algorithm and its fixed-boundary completion proof.
- [ ] **Audit every remaining `kBranchTopologyTolerance` comparison for dimensional coherence.**
  `direction_in_incident_vertex_sector` compares a Gram **determinant** — an area-squared quantity — to
  `1e-10`. After E2/E3 the surviving uses are admissibility guards only, but their scale is arbitrary and
  mesh-size dependent. Not a CP4c-0 measure; do not fold it into CB2.
- [ ] **Sweep for other tolerant-selector / exact-consumer seams.** CP4c-0 found the pattern three times
  in one subsystem (flow classification, vertex sector, cross-edge flow). The same audit is owed wherever
  an exact authority was introduced downstream of a `double` decision.

---

Current stable totals are **44 events / 14 categories / 30 recurrences**. Produced-witness debt remains **5**. Authoritative semantic M3 package count is **88**. **TB22 remains the latest runtime authority until TB23-R1 executes; CB25 package `9921914679` / selector397 remains immutable, and CB26's corrected harness is preflight-proved with no runtime/rebuild.** Exact next is `M3-CP4c-3-TB23-R1`, followed by independent `M3-CP4c-3-TB23-R1-REV`. PR #8 remains open, draft, and unmerged.
